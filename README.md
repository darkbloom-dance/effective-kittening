# Welcome To Effective Kittening!

Meowdy! This repository is a collection of philosophy, notes, and checklists I use to ensure a show runs as smooth as it can. Everything here is from the perspective of a kitten that works with the same troupe/company.

# Philosophy

Play the support role by and make the show run as smooth as possible by:
- Helping out the performers, producers, tech, and venue owner get whatever they need to succeed.
- Setup and breakdown each act in the show. Sometimes this is picking up bras, sometimes this is dragging a pool of fake blood across a stage, sometimes this is sifting the crumpled up dollar bills out of a pile of feathers.
- Ensure things are safe. Remove trip hazards, tape off cables, tape over nails in the stage.

# Checklists
I love me a good spreadsheet.
