# Sticking Things To Other Things
Trip hazards need to be tamed. Sometimes costumes need some help. This stuff helps you do that.

- [ ] Toupee/boob tape
- [ ] Lash glue
- [ ] Sewing kit
    - [ ] safety pins
    - [ ] scissors
    - [ ] thread
    - [ ] needles
    - [ ] buttons
- [ ] Fishing line
- [ ] Gaffers' tape (having a few colors is handy for marking prop locations on stage, keeping wires out of the way, etc)
- [ ] Black duct tape (not for wires, but for things that need to be affixed 'permanantly')

# Documents
Before a show, I like to print out the lineup, kitten notes, and emcee notes. These get handed out to the announcer, sound tech, and a few for the green room.

- [ ] Lineup (the show list)
- [ ] Kitten notes (your annotated lineup, "who needs chairs", "where do those chairs go?", "where does this crown go?", etc)
- [ ] Emcee notes (your announcer's annotated lineup; performer's name, song, and anything that should be said before the act)
- [ ] Notebook (near 100% chance you have someone running up to you before the show with a last second change)
- [ ] Sharpies/Pens (see above)

# Ouchies

- [ ] Bandaids
- [ ] Antibiotic cream
- [ ] Chewable tums/pepto
- [ ] Acetaminophen
- [ ] Gum (handy before going on stage)

# Cleanup

- [ ] Makeup removal wipes
- [ ] Isopropyl alcohol
- [ ] Nitrile Gloves
- [ ] PAPER üëè TOWELS üëè
- [ ] Wet Cloth + Dry Cloth (do NOT try to sweep up chalk or talc powder, it becomes a slippery mess)
- [ ] Bath towels (especially if there's a performer doing a waterpour)
- [ ] Laundry bags (take some tape and tag the bags with the act, then jam all of that act's stuff into the matching bag)
- [ ] Swiffer/broom (sometimes a box of Lucky Charms explodes on to the stage for a St. Patricks Day act)
- [ ] 2x Trash bags
- [ ] Gallon sized ziplock bags

# Weird Stuff That Has Come Up

- [ ] Protein/candy bars (especially if you're at a venue from 4:30 to 11:30, not to mention the 2 hours of driving to get there. Someone is going to eventually be hangry, have a way to stave it off)
- [ ] 1/4" patch cables (sometimes performers play violin, guitar, modular synth, etc.)
- [ ] XLR cables (sometimes they have their own microphone, too!)
- [ ] Power strip
- [ ] USB-C and Lightning cables
